# Exploring Network Detection and Response (NDR) with Kali Linux and Metasploitable

## Objective

The purpose of this lab is to provide hands-on experience with Network Detection and Response (NDR) solutions by simulating real-world attacks using Kali Linux and Metasploitable. Participants will learn how to identify vulnerabilities, exploit them, and analyze how an NDR system detects and responds to malicious activities within a network.

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of network security concepts.
- Familiarity with penetration testing tools (e.g., Metasploit).
- Access to a virtual lab environment with Hyper-V installed.

## Lab Environment
- Kali Linux: A powerful penetration testing distribution that includes numerous tools for ethical hacking and network security assessments.
- Metasploitable: An intentionally vulnerable Linux distribution designed for testing and training purposes. It allows participants to practice penetration testing techniques.
- NDR Solution (e.g., Vectra AI): A monitoring tool that provides visibility into network traffic, detects anomalies, and responds to potential threats.

## Key Learning Outcomes
- Understand the principles of NDR and its importance in modern cybersecurity.
- Gain hands-on experience in reconnaissance, exploitation, and post-exploitation techniques.
- Analyze alerts and logs generated by the NDR solution during simulated attacks.
- Discuss the effectiveness of NDR in detecting and mitigating threats.

## Lab Activities
- Reconnaissance: Use nmap to scan the Metasploitable VM, identifying open ports and services.
- Exploitation: Utilize Metasploit to exploit vulnerabilities in Metasploitable, demonstrating common attack techniques.
- Post-Exploitation: Simulate actions an attacker might take after gaining access, such as privilege escalation and data exfiltration.
- Monitoring and Analysis: Observe and analyze alerts generated by the NDR solution, discussing detection capabilities and incident response.

## Ethical Considerations
This lab is intended for educational purposes only. Participants are reminded to operate within a controlled environment and adhere to ethical hacking principles. All activities should be performed in compliance with relevant laws and organizational policies.
