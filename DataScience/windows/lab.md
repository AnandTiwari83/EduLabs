# Getting started with Datascience

## Overview

In this lab environment, you will access the Windows Data Science VM which has several popular tools for data exploration, analysis, modeling & development pre-installed.

The Windows Data Science Virtual Machine (DSVM) is a virtual machine image available in Azure that's preinstalled with a collection of tools commonly used for data analytics and machine learning.

The DSVM image makes it easy to get started doing data science in minutes, without having to install and configure each of the tools individually. You can easily stop it when it's not in use. The DSVM resource is both elastic and cost-efficient.

### JupyterLab
JupyterLab is the latest web-based interactive development environment for notebooks, code, and data. Its flexible interface allows users to configure and arrange workflows in data science, scientific computing, computational journalism, and machine learning. A modular design invites extensions to expand and enrich functionality.

### Jupyter Notebook
The Jupyter Notebook is the original web application for creating and sharing computational documents. It offers a simple, streamlined, document-centric experience.

After completing this lab, you will learn how to:

- Log in to JupyterLab Portal
- Execute Notebooks
- Verify the notebook execution output

## Instructions

1. Once the environment is provisioned, a virtual machine (JumpVM) on the left and lab guide on the right will get loaded in your browser. Use this virtual machine throughout the workshop to perform the lab.

## Access the JupyterLab Application

1. In the virtual machine, double click on the **Jupyter** icon on the desktop to start the Jupyter Notebook.

2. This will open up a command prompt and a browser will automatically load and navigate you to the JupyterLab application.

   **Note:** If you see the page Welcome to Microsoft Edge, then click on Start without your data and continue. 
   
3. Once the Jupyter Lab loads up, you will see the File System on the left and **Launcher** on the right.

7. Set the Kernel as **Python 3.6 - AzureML - AutoML** (1) , select the cell (2) and click on **Run > (3)** icon to execute the notebook.
   You will see the output(3) as shown in the screenshot.

8. Before executing the remaining cells, login to the **Azure Portal** (<http://portal.azure.com>) using the following email/username and Password and ensure to use the resource group **dslab-<inject key="DeploymentID"></inject>** for performing the lab.

   * **Azure Username/Email**:  <inject key="AzureAdUserEmail"></inject> 
   * **Azure Password**:  <inject key="AzureAdUserPassword"></inject>

9. Continue to run the remaining cells and provide the necessary values of Subscription ID, Resource Group, Workspace name whereever required. 
   >You can get the values by logging to the **Azure Portal** (<http://portal.azure.com>) from the resource group **dslab-<inject key="DeploymentID"></inject>** overview->Essentials tab.

10. While creating the **CPU Cluster** and **GPU Cluster**, update the size to **STANDARD_NC4AS_T4_V3** in the cell and then click Run.

11. After executing the notebook to check if you have successfully executed the notebook, verify if all the resources are created in the resource group **dslab-<inject key="DeploymentID"></inject>** .
   ![](../images/resources.png)
    
12. Also, ensure that the compute resources **cpu-cluster and gpu-cluster** as mentioned in the notebook are created by navigating to the Machine Learning studio and **Compute** tab.
    ![](../images/compute.png)

13. Similarly, you can navigate to the **/notebooks** directory which has a lot of sample notebooks loaded up for the various technologies and are pre-provisioned within the lab environment. You can explore through the notebooks and perform any exercise with the datascience virtual machine (DSVM).
   
 ## Summary
 
 In this lab environment, you have accessed the JupyterLab application, executed a notebook to configure the Azure Machine learning workspace, and explored other notebooks.
